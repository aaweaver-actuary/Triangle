# `triangle` - data class representing a property-casualty loss development triangle

## Overview 
`triangle` is a lightweight Python package for working with property-casualty loss development triangles. It is designed to be easy to use, with a simple API and minimal dependencies. It is also designed to be fast, with a focus on vectorized operations and efficient memory usage.

This package was mainly developed for use in my `rocky` loss reserve modeling package, but it can be used independently of `rocky` as well. Includes io methods and basic chain-ladder functionality as well.
